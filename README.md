A live calculator someone might want to use

This project uses:
* Chartist for easy chart implementation
* Finnhub for current and historical prices
* Materialize for CSS Framework

API reasearch: Kermit
Front-end: Kermit and Conrad
Back-end: Daniel

Most of our challenges was trying to find the API to use. It was difficult to find a API that didnâ€™t cost money.

In the future we would like to add:
* Different currencies we could convert from.
* Mobile support
